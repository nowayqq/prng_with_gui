# Pseudorandom Number Generator with GUI

I implemented several PRNG methods, wrapped them in a friendly interface.

Used materials: http://blog.tkachuk.su/, https://medium.com/geekculture/custom-made-plots-in-python-with-pysimplegui-9f7618fab8d5, https://towardsdatascience.com/integrating-pyplot-and-pysimplegui-b68be606b960

To run the UI, install everything you need from requirments.txt, then open the folder with the .py files in cmd and write 'python main.py' there
